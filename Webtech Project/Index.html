Our extremely friendly kindergarten teachers ensure that young children learn the right things. And as these children grow, we teach them how to become aware of their interests, goals and potential. We have some of the best career counselors in the country who guide children with career planning. And encourage them to dream, dare and do.

          <p>All Cambridge International Schools have an extremely qualified and committed faculty. In fact, most recruited staff has had exposure to international educational systems in India and abroad. They are trained in the activity-based learning and teaching method. In addition, lesson planning, classroom performance and contribution to co-curricular activities are under constant supervision of the Principals of each schools, who believe that the quality of teaching and learning must be of the highest order-day-by-day, hour-by-hour, lesson-by-lesson.

</p>
            <p><strong>The schools are also committed to staff development through a wide range of on-going in-service programmes and workshops, which cover not only academics and pedagogy but also areas such as psychological counseling, personality development and career counseling. The staff and student ratio is 1:10. Hence each child receives individual attention and feels comfortable to approach teachers for help in and out of classrooms.</p>

At Cambridge International Foundation School what matters the most is our students. They are our strength, our answer to the world. We believe in them and give them freedom and opportunities to follow their hearts and become whatever they want to be. We, at Cambridge , nurture their dreams intellectually and emotionally. We challenge our students academically, help them grow socially and guide them to think independently and critically. Our school motto ‘Dream, Dare, Do’ reflects this ideology of ours where we open windows for our students to follow their dreams and take pride in what they do.

We believe in inculcating skills in our students to make them life long learners. Our approach is to teach beyond books and classrooms, helping them apply their knowledge to unfamiliar situations. Freedom of thought as well as expression is given to every student. Exposure to opportunities is not limited only to national level but also international level where our students go to UK, Japan and China under the exchange programme, hence we make them global while carrying and respecting our Indian culture in their hearts.

CIFS is an amalgamation of experienced and competent staff, efficient administration, modern and secure infrastructure, CBSE, CIE and IB curriculum and above all, healthy environment where students share a friendly bond with their teachers. The aim of the school is to develop the best that is hidden in children, and to prepare them for the challenges of the changing world through the encouragement of self discipline, high intellectual achievements and physical fitness.

Our greatest support is the parents who have shown trust in us and stood by us in every challenge. With their cooperation, the school will continue to achieve the purpose of education, that is, to replace an empty mind with an open one.
