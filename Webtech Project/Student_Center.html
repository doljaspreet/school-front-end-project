        <strong><h2><span>Clubs</span></h2></strong>
        <p><strong>School Clubs at CIFS</strong><br />
At CIFS, Our aim is not only to develop intellectual aspects of personality, but to supplement & refine students’ personality with Co-Curricular activities and nourish them to superior qualities such as aesthetic development, character building, spiritual growth, physical growth, moral values, creativity, to develop co-ordination, adjustment, speech fluency, extempore expressions, etc. And to achieve this goal, we have divided the whole strength of students into the following clubs.
<br />
Keeping this in mind, we have launched a few Clubs and the details for the same are given below:
<br />
<strong>1. M.F Hussain’s Club: </strong><br />Art ignites and takes young minds on a creatively fulfilling journey. Our Art Club exposes children to different creative experiences. The students learn about different kinds of art like Abstract Painting, Lino Art, Collage Making and many more.<br />

<strong>2. Music and Dance Club:</strong><br /> Music lessons not only foster a love of music, but also help children in dealing with stress and nervousness.Therefore to make them feel the rhythm of music, we have the Music and Dance Club where they learn different dance forms like Patriotic Dance, Lavani Dance of Maharashtra, Bihu Dance of Assam, Kalbeliya Dance of Haryana and Ghoomar Dance of Gujarat.<br />

<strong>3. Literary Club:</strong><br /> Every child is good in one or the other field. The Literary club exposes the students to varied forms associated with literature and it’s several other dynamic branches. We also prepare students for Role Plays, Mime, and Stage Performances etc in all languages.<br />

<strong>4. Vishvanathan Club:</strong><br /> Running is not a sport for everyone. It is about the sweat in your hair and the blisters on your feet. It is about throbbing calves and cramps at midnight. At CIFS, we motivate our students to get outdoors and run, when the whole world is only dreaming about it. In our Club, we have Indoor Games like Table Tennis, Chess, Badminton and outdoor games like Basket Ball, Kho- Kho and many more to keep our students physically fit and active and to enhance sportsman spirit in them.</p>

          <strong><h2><span>Expeditions/Educational Trips/Adventure Camps</span></h2></strong>
          <p>
          Technology has proved to be a boon for us. Everything is being solved with a click of button. But when we physically experience anything , it remains in our mind and heart forever. Cambridge believes in conceptual knowledge and practicality. So keeping this thing in mind , Cambridge International Foundation School organized an educational trip to Bhakra Nangal Dam under the guidance of Mr. Amandeep Singh and Mr. Ajay Wadhwa. This trip eased students and made them clear about the doubts lingering in their minds. It also helped them in scoring marks in their final exams. It was a lifelong learning for students.<br />

Visit to ICP at Amritsar was another amazing experience where the students could encounter the patriotic feelings in their heart.  Easing out of trade regulation between the India and Pakistan was discussed with students.</p>
 <strong><h2><span>Music/Dance/Drama Studio</span></h2></strong><p>Indian classical & folk dance, western music & dance, instrumental music and singing are offered to students to develop their skills and musical appreciation. Each child takes part in at least one activity at the annual cultural event to develop stage confidence.</p>
 
 <strong><h2><span>Sports</span></h2></strong>
 
 <p>The development of mind and body go hand-in-hand. In short, physical educations plays a vital role in creating well-rounded confident individuals. Therefore, sports are an integral part of our education system.</p>

         We understand that parents’ active participation in the activities of their children in school is essential if we are to flourish as community. We would like the parents’ experience to be a positive one. Parents are kept informed of all school events through a newsletter. They follow their child’s progress through regular and detailed school reports. We also welcome parents to visit our schools to discuss matters of concern with House Tutor/House-mother.
